           <h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
           <time> Friday, 27th March 2020 </time>
           <p>We’d like to say a huge big “thank you” to everyone who has signed-up to volunteer
            for Tisbury Neighbourhood Response, (TNR). </p>
            <p>So far almost 150 people have registered and we’re sorry we haven’t been able to get back to you all yet! This is
            because we’ve been setting up systems to support this growing army of volunteers.</p>
            <p>So please bear with us as we improve and build capacity. We’ll be in touch soon.</p>
            <p>These are very difficult times but your response to our call for volunteers shows how
            kind people can be and that we can get through this as a community.</p>
            <p>Keep safe and healthy.</p>
            <p>Best Wishes<br>
            Tisbury Neighbourhood Response</p>
